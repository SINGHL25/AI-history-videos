00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Welcome to the Untold History of India.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Today, we revisit the spark that lit the fire of independence – the Revolt of 1857.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,000
It was not just a mutiny. It was India’s first major struggle against British colonial rule.

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,000
The revolt began on 10th May 1857 in Meerut.

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Angry Indian sepoys of the British East India Company rose up in rebellion.

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:26,000
The cause? Greased cartridges rumored to be laced with cow and pig fat.

8
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Deeply offensive to both Hindu and Muslim beliefs.

9
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:33,000
But the fire was fueled by years of resentment – economic exploitation, cultural disrespect.

10
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
And racial discrimination.

11
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,000
From Delhi to Kanpur, Lucknow to Jhansi – brave leaders rose.

12
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Mangal Pandey, Rani Lakshmibai, Tantia Tope, Bahadur Shah Zafar.

13
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
The British called it a “mutiny”. But for Indians, it was the First War of Independence.

14
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Though eventually suppressed, it ignited a national consciousness.

15
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,000
It sowed the seeds for a freedom movement that would never die.

16
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Let’s remember their sacrifice – and keep the flame of freedom alive.
